# FCN-Road-Segmentation

## In this project, I use fully convolutional neural-networks in making road semantic segmentation with KITTI data. 

## The code uses pre-trained VGG16 network and trains the transpose convolution layers. 

## The powerpoint file is my presentation with training results.

## One can download the training data from: http://www.cvlibs.net/download.php?file=data_road.zip

## Start training with a GPU: python train.py
